# The Ender

SkyForgeBot is an RLBot-compatible Rocket League bot powered by TorchScript models.
This document describes installing dependencies, training new models, and
packaging the bot for RLBot Championship submissions.

## Dependencies and Installation

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8+.
2. Install runtime dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r SkyForgeBot/requirements.txt
   ```
3. (Optional) For training, install the additional dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r env/requirements.txt
   ```

## Training new weights

Run the provided training script to produce a TorchScript actor:
```bash
python training/train.py
```
By default the resulting model is written to `SkyForgeBot/necto-model.pt` which
is the path referenced by `SkyForgeBot/bot.cfg`.  This means RLBot will load the
new weights automatically on the next match.  To save the model somewhere else
set the `SKYFORGEBOT_MODEL_PATH` environment variable before running the
training script.

You can also launch the training process through RLBot by using
`training/bot.cfg` directly or referencing it from `rlbot.cfg`.

## Packaging for RLBot Championship

1. Ensure the following files are present in the repository:
   - `SkyForgeBot/bot.cfg`
   - `SkyForgeBot/appearance.cfg`
   - `SkyForgeBot/logo.png`
   - `SkyForgeBot/requirements.txt`
   - `bob.toml` and `bot.toml`
   - the model file referenced by `bot.cfg`
2. Install the packager and build a release zip:
   ```bash
   pip install rlbotpackager
   python -m rlbotpackager package
   ```
   The resulting archive in `dist/` is ready for RLBot Championship submission.

## 120â€¯Hz execution tips

- `SkyForgeBot/bot.cfg` sets `maximum_tick_rate_preference = 120`.
- In the RLBot GUI or runner, verify the match is configured for 120 tick
  rate; lower rates will slow decision making.

## Verifying 2v2 compatibility

`training/train.py` builds a 2v2 environment (`team_size=2`), so the agent
defaults to supporting two cars per team.  To confirm it works in game:

1. Launch RLBot and configure a match with two `SkyForgeBot` instances per team.
2. Start the match and ensure all four bots spawn and respond without errors.
